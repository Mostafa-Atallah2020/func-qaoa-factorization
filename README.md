# 12_Integer-factorization-through-QAOA

**Name of Mentor:** Adam Glos,  Özlem Salehi Köken (Algorithmiq; Institute of Theoretical and Applied Informatics, Polish Academy of Sciences)

**Brief Description:** QAOA is a well-known quantum optimization algorithm suitable for NISQ-era quantum computing. There have been attempts to solve the integer factorization problem which lies in the core of modern cryptography using variational quantum algorithms. In the scope of this project, we plan to propose a resource-efficient alternative representation for the integer factorization problem, with a particular focus on QAOA. We plan to summarize the results with an open-source code and a scientific publication.
