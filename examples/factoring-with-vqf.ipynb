    "This function creates clauses for the VQF (Variational Quantum Factoring) algorithm, which is a quantum algorithm for factoring integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function takes as input an integer `m_int` to be factored, and optionally known factors `true_p_int` and `true_q_int`. It also has boolean flags `apply_preprocessing` and `verbose`, which control whether to apply certain simplifications and whether to print information during the execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function returns four dictionaries (`p_dict`, `q_dict`, `z_dict`, and `known_symbols`) that represent the variables used in the VQF algorithm, as well as a list of clauses (`final_clauses`) that represent the optimization problem. The `p_dict` and `q_dict` dictionaries represent the bits of the factors `p` and `q`, respectively, while `z_dict` represents the carry bits. The `known_symbols` dictionary contains the known values of `p`, `q`, and `z`, which are used to simplify the clauses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `create_clauses` function first creates the initial dictionaries using `create_initial_dicts`. It then applies preprocessing to the dictionaries if `apply_preprocessing` is `True`. The preprocessing includes setting the leading bits of `p` and `q` to 1 and removing unnecessary carry bits. The function then creates the basic clauses using `create_basic_clauses`, which represent the optimization problem for the VQF algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "If `apply_preprocessing` is `True`, the function simplifies the clauses using `simplify_clauses` and updates the dictionaries based on the known expressions using `update_dictionaries`. The function then creates a new set of final clauses using the simplified clauses.\n",

    "If the final clauses are all equal to 0 and there are still unknown variables, the function raises an exception. Otherwise, the function returns the dictionaries and final clauses.\n",
